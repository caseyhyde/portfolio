      <h3>Skateboarders around the world enjoy skating at all sorts of unique spots. With the exception of established skateparks, none of these can be found via typical map services (Google Maps&trade;). What about that sweet handrail behind he grocery store in uptown? How about the loading dock on the side of the downtown hardware store? How do skateboarders find these places if they are new to an area? How can they let the world know about a cool new spot they found tucked away in the suburbs?</h3>
    </div>
    <h1><b>The Solution:</b></h1>
    <div class="projectSolution">
      <h3>Spot Check! A web application developed to help skateboarders around the world share their favorite spots with other skateboards. New in town? Use the search feature to browse spots by location or keyword(stairs, ledge, hubba, rail, etc)... Found a sweet new spot that you think others should know about? Use the add spot feature to upload a new spot. Since a spot wouldn't be complete without photos, users can upload up to ten photos of their new spot at a time. The best part is, no registration required! Simply visit the website and begin browsing immidiately! To prevent robots from filling the spot database with nonsense, an email verification system is in place requiring users to verify their spot via email before it is hosted on the main website. The same system is used to allow only users who created a spot to edit/delete it.</h3>

      <h3>We start with a grid. Every cycle, the rules are applied to each square in the grid.</h3>
      <h2>I built a cool feature into my version I dubbed Methuselah Rain</h2>
      <h3>The game works as a typical Game Of Life, except when Methuselah Rain is toggled on. This Uses the Random.org API to generate an array of random numbers corresponding to locations on the game grid. Every 30 generations, a R-pentomino Methuselah is draw onto the grid at one of the random locations pulled from the API. The result is a game that never stops growing, regardless of interaction.<h3>
